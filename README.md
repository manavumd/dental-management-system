The platform includes:

- User authentication and session management
- CRUD operations for Clinics, Doctors, and Patients
- Appointment scheduling and Visit management
- REST API for integration with external systems

## Assumptions

- Each doctor can have multiple specialties, but these are shared across clinics.
- Doctors can have different working hours in different clinics.
- No buffer time is required between appointments.
- Patients can have multiple visits and appointments.
- **Appointment Duration**: Each appointment has a fixed duration of **15 minutes**. The system checks if there are any 15-minute slots available between the start and end time of the doctor's schedule, while considering other scheduled appointments.
- Tests are run using **SQLite**, and the production environment uses **PostgreSQL**.
